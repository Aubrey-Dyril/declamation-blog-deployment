            <h2>JANUARY 25, 2025</h2>
            <p class="date">Good afternoon, Sir Myke! I am Aubrey Dyril D. Tagadtad sharing my experience/s
                during our declamation program.
            <p>
                Our declamation experience was fun yet exhausting. We practiced tirelessly to deliver a perfect performance for the audience. 
                In the end, all our efforts were worth it—they loved our performance, and I felt happy and grateful as we received an emotional 
                round of applause. </p>

            <p>
                Our performance was inspired by Pulang Araw and Maria Clara. It depicted the suffering of people during the war, as the Japanese 
                attacked the Philippines, and the betrayals they experienced from their supposed allies. </p>

            <p>    
                We poured our emotions into the performance, with anger and sadness as the dominant themes. 
                We shouted, cried, and symbolized the strength of those who survived the war. </p>

            <p>
                Backstage, we struggled to set up our props, but thankfully, everything was delivered to the stage on time. We also brought our costumes,
                and since I played two characters, it was a challenge to change outfits quickly. </p>

            <p>
               In the end, our roleplay successfully conveyed the horrors of war to the audience. 
               Our advisor and teachers were proud of us for creating a performance that was both exquisite and iconic. </p>
